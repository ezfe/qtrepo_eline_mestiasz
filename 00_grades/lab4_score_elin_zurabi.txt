-- Comments ------------------

- Robot does not increase in level and robots do not move when hero teleports.

- No unit-testing for the new Engine Class.

- Gameboard needs to be deleted in the opposite order it is created.

- When a method is named init that would suggest it is initializing, but your
  init method: Initializes, runs main functionality, and closes up the program.
  The constructor and destructor should be used, the rename the init method to
  something that matches functionality.
